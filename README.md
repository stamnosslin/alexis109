# alexis109
This R library contains data from an experiment (called alexis109) on lateralization and detection of lag-clicks in lead-lag click pairs. This is data for a *manuscript in preparation*, hopefully ready to submit to journal before summer holidays 2018.  

To insstall in R, first install the **devtools** library, then:
<br>
devtools::install_github("stamnosslin/alexis109")

The library contains three data sets:

+ **data109lat**, data from three listeners on lateralization of lag clicks
+ **data109det**, data from the same thre listeners on detection of lag clicks
+ **data109rov**, data from the same thre listeners and two more on laterlization of lag clicks, including one condition with level roving (this was an extra experiment to check the usefulness of monaural cues for laterlization of inter-aural level differences)
