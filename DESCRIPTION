Description: This package contains data from an experiment called ALEXIS 109. ALEXIS 
  stands for Auditory Learning and EXpertISe, and 109 is the number of a specific experiment,
  the data of which is contained in this package. The experiment measured laterlaization
  and detection thresholds of a 10 dB inter-aural-level differences in lagging part of lead-lag click pairs, for
