\description{
This is data from an experiment with five participants, tested on tested on 
lateralization of a large binaural difference in lag clicks following a lead click 
after an inter-click interval of 4 ms. The binaural difference was 
an ITD of 0.35 ms or an ILD of 10 dB or both. The overall level of the first
and second interval was randomly and independently roved +/- 10 dB in the roving
condition
