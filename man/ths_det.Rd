\description{
This is processed data (estimated thresholds) from an experiment with three participants, tested on detection
of a lag click following a lead click after
an inter-click interval between 0.125 to 256 ms. The binaural difference of the lag click was
an ITD of 0.35 ms or an ILD of 10 dB or both or none.
